## 8SMC1 CalX UI

This directory contains implementation of extended system GUI. It is based on wxWidgets 3.1.0(see README to build). This component is called CalX UI for no particular reason(however it was useful to give it name because of C++ namespace and component class names - they start with Calx prefix). Main purpose of this UI is cover whole system core functionality, thus interface itself may seem complicated(it's hard to combine large functionality and intuitive UI).
