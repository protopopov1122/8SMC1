## CalX User Interface
Graphical User Interface is the main goal of development, so currently it represents Ctrl-lib offered functions better that CLI. On the other hand, GUI may seem quite complex because it tends to cover most functionality.
##### Interface organization
Main program window is split into 4 tabs to mirror Ctrl-lib subsystem structure. There are also other dialogs: initial configuration selector and debug-console.
##### Devices tab
