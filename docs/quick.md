## CalX Quick system guide
This manual page quickly describes system configuration and usage. Links to appropriate manual sections are also provided.

CalX system is distribution consists of several files, all of them should be unpacked and placed in one directory. CalX UI(user interface) may be opened by executing 'calxui.exe'. This will load available configurations(and offer selection if multiple configurations are available). Then appropriate driver will be loaded and the main program window will appear(as well as debug console, if debug mode is on). [Detailed UI description](gui.md)

Before work you should configure used devices in the first application tab. Some devices may be preloaded by current driver, but some of them must be connected at runtime. Generally, you should review already connected devices(check their parameters, state and power) and then connect other devices using buttons on the top(after clicking connection dialog will appear).

After device configuration you may switch to the second tab called 'Coordinate Planes'. There you should create coordinate plane using devices configured before(be careful while selecting devices, they must correspond physical X-Y axis). Then coordinate plane should be configured(otherwise it will lack some useful functionality like previews) - most convenient way is clicking 'Configure' button in the position plane on the right(then plane will be automatically measured and centered).

Then you may manipulate with coordinate plane or switch to the 'Tasks' tab. There you can load and perform different complex actions. Two most useful are:
* GCode task - you should have prepared file with so-called GCode(which may be generated by different tools: Inkscape plugin, dxf2code converter etc.). This GCode may be executed by CalX(however it's quite limited in commends. [See compatibility](compat.md)).
* Linear task - creates sequence of lines on selected plane. You may adjust line configuration and spacing.

CalX system may throw different error types. Errors are indicated using error codes. All codes are described [there](error.md). CalX mathematical engine is quite simple and its discussed [here](math.md). You may read full manual list [there](README.md). CalX repo is on [GitHub](https://github.com/protopopov1122/CalX)

System parameter configuration is located at 'Configuration' tab. Some parameters may changed there and they will instantly change, others must be changed from used *.conf.ini file.
