## Installation and building
As soon as it will be possible, binary project builds will be available on GitHub, but currently only build from source is possible.

CalX system supports two build systems. First one is CMake: it is easier to use on Linux and newer Windows platforms, more clear and standart. However older Windows versions(which is used in university physics lab) require other type of building - custom written Makefile for cross-compilation from Linux using MinGW. This build way is complex, 'dirty' and not recommended for use.

After build with both build systems 'build' directory will be generated. Basically, it includes system that is ready for use.
#### CMake build
##### Windows
If you are on Windows, you may use both MS Visual C++ and MinGW compilers(with posix threads) to build CalX system. You also need statically-built unicode wxWidgets 3.1.0 library(you should use the same compiler for CalX and wxWidgets building) and CMake installed.
```bash
mkdir build # It's recomended to build out-of-source
cd build
```
* For MSVC
```bash
cmake ..
msbuild CalX.sln /p:Configuration=Release /m
```
You could also use NMake this way:
```bash
cmake .. -G"NMake Makefiles"
nmake /f Makefile
```
* For MinGW - you may build statically linked binaries by adding -DMINGW_STATIC_LINKAGE=ON to cmake flags
```bash
cmake .. -G"MinGW Makefiles"
mingw32-make -jN    # N - parallel job count
```

Then you can generate installer by executing 'cpack' command(if you have NSIS installed).

##### Linux
Make sure that you installed build tools, cmake and wxWidgets library. Then you can build this way:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build    # Building out-of-source
cmake ..
make -jN    # N - parallel job count
```
However, installation currently is not properly configured, so you may use system from build directory(make sure you modified LD_LIBRARY_PATH before start).


#### Custom build system
It is used to prepare builds for older Windows versions, because it links runtime statically. Build system relies on Makefile generated by bash script. It works on both Linux and WSL.

To regenerate Makefile you should execute:
```bash
./misc/old-build/gen-makefile.sh > ./misc/old-build/Makefile # From the top project directory
```
And to build:
```bash
make -f ./misc/old-build/Makefile all BUILD=[BUILD] -jN WX=[WX] WXLIB=[WXLIB] # BUILD - build directory, N - processor core count, WX - path to wxWidgets library, WXLIB - path wxWidgets DLL relatively to [WX]
```
