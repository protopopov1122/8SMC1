## Installation and building
As soon as it will be possible, binary project builds will be available on GitHub, but currently only build from source is possible.

CalX system supports two build systems. First one is CMake: it is easier to use on Linux and newer Windows platforms, more clear and standart. However older Windows versions(which is used in university physics lab) require other type of building - custom written Makefile for cross-compilation from Linux using MinGW. This build way is complex, 'dirty' and not recommended for use.

After build with both build systems 'build' directory will be generated. Basically, it includes system that is ready for use.
#### Dependencies
Project has several dependencies:
* CMake - used as a build system
* Compilers - MS Visual C++, MinGW-w64, GCC, Clang are supported
* wxWidgets 3.1.0 - graphics library for user interface. For MinGW you may compile it with 'RUNTIME_LIBS=static' key to get stand-alone build without dependencies
* Lua 5.3 - used as a scripting engine. Download Lua 5.3 sources and copy all *.c and *.h files from src directory to res/lua. Then download Selene Lua bindings and copy selene.h and selene directory to res/selene. Project may be compiled without them, but scripting will be disabled.
* MicroSMC headers - if you are using standart drivers for 8SMC1 motors, you should copy USMCDLL.h from your MicroSMC installation to res directory
#### CMake build
##### Windows
If you are on Windows, you may use both MS Visual C++ and MinGW compilers(with posix threads) to build CalX system. You also need statically-built unicode wxWidgets 3.1.0 library(you should use the same compiler for CalX and wxWidgets building) and CMake installed.
```bash
mkdir build # It's recomended to build out-of-source
cd build
```
* For MSVC
```bash
cmake ..
cmake --build . -- /p:Configuration=Release /m
```
You could also use NMake this way:
```bash
cmake .. -G"NMake Makefiles"
cmake --build .
```
* For MinGW - you may build statically linked binaries by adding -DMINGW_STATIC_LINKAGE=ON to cmake flags
Then you will receive completely dependency-free binaries(assuming you compiled wxWidgets with 'RUNTIME_LIBS=static')
```bash
cmake .. -G"MinGW Makefiles"
cmake --build . -- -jN    # N - parallel job count
```

Then you can generate installer by executing 'cpack' command(if you have NSIS installed).

##### Linux
Make sure that you installed build tools, cmake and wxWidgets library, Lua and Selene sources. Then you can build this way:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build    # Building out-of-source
cmake ..
cmake --build . -- -jN    # N - parallel job count
```
However, installation currently is not properly configured, so you may use system from build directory(make sure you modified LD_LIBRARY_PATH before start).


#### Custom build system
__Currently it's outdated and no longer maintained. CMake builds work perfectly.__
It is used to prepare builds for older Windows versions, because it links runtime statically. Build system relies on Makefile generated by bash script. It works on both Linux and WSL.

To regenerate Makefile you should execute:
```bash
./misc/old-build/gen-makefile.sh > ./misc/old-build/Makefile # From the top project directory
```
And to build:
```bash
make -f ./misc/old-build/Makefile all BUILD=[BUILD] -jN WX=[WX] WXLIB=[WXLIB] # BUILD - build directory, N - processor core count, WX - path to wxWidgets library, WXLIB - path wxWidgets DLL relatively to [WX]
```
