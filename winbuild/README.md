## Winbuild

This directory contains *.bat files that compile project using MSVC compiler. They must be called from project root and require MSVC compiler and linker to be in path and allow building both exe and all for Native C++ and Managed C++/CLI. List of files:
* build-stub.bat - build stub library to test software.
* build-exe.bat - build native executable.
* build-dll.bat - build native dynamic library.
* build-clr.bat - build C++/CLI executable.
* build-clr-dll.bat - build C++/CLI dynamic library.

## Notice
These files are autogenerated by misc/gen-winbuild bash script, so do not edit them and after new source file adding you should rebuild them(using WSL or Linux):
```bash
misc/gen-winbuild	# Execute from project root
```
