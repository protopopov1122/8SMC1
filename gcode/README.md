## G-Code parser
This directory contains implementation of simple G-Code parser. It allows parsing *.ngc line-by-line. All blanklines, comments and excess whitespaces are ignored. It tested by example code generated by Inkscape G-Code plugin.
## Note
Currently this parser is not used by the rest of project, so it also includes simple main function to build it as standalone console application. It parses file passed in the first argument and logs commands and parameters to console.
